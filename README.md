# Julieta v1 Automation Projects

Welcome to the **Julieta v1 Automation Projects** repository! This project demonstrates the use of the Julieta v1 board to create two exciting automation projects: a **Line-Following Robot** and an **Anti-Collision System**. Both projects combine the power of hardware control and programming to bring intelligent automation to life.

## Overview
The goal of this repository is to showcase how to utilize the Julieta v1 board with motors and sensors to develop functional and interactive robotic systems. These projects are perfect for learning about robotics, automation, and programming.

### Projects Included
1. **Line-Following Robot**:
   - A robot that can follow a predefined path using line-tracking sensors.
   - Ideal for exploring algorithms related to navigation and path following.

2. **Anti-Collision System**:
   - A robot equipped with sensors to detect and avoid obstacles in its path.
   - Great for learning about real-time decision-making and object detection.

## Features
- Utilizes the **Julieta v1** microcontroller board for control.
- Includes support for motor drivers and various sensors.
- Easy-to-understand code and wiring diagrams provided.

## Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - Julieta v1 board
  - Motors (DC or Servo, depending on the project)
  - Line-tracking sensors
  - Ultrasonic or infrared sensors (for anti-collision system)
  - Battery pack or power supply
- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE or compatible programming environment

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/julieta-v1.git
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the respective project folders:
   - `line-following-robot/`
   - `anti-collision-system/`
3. Upload the provided code to the Julieta v1 board using the Arduino IDE.
4. Assemble the hardware as per the included wiring diagrams.
5. Test and enjoy your automated robots!
